Just thought professor Chomsky would like a nice example of creative linguistics to have around in his great experience So I’m creating an open and engaging game and platform to practice the inner mechanisms of actually creating words from your own entropy. And it’s actually fun! ✨</p><p>First, ЭТОВОТЭТО (THISISIT) is a fun board game for a company of 3-12 people with markers and empty cards. We’ve played it dozens of times and it’s really a great exercise for our deep creativity. So here are the short rules:</p><p>Every participant gets a couple of empty cards to fill with imaginary words (you don’t need to know the meaning at all). We collect them, mix them and then one of us becomes a host. He/she takes a card, reads it, comes up with a clear imagined meaning and says the definition aloud (word is not shown). Other players write down their word to the definition to an empty card. They’re mixed with the initial, then opened and read aloud. After we vote about what was the initial one with any small pieces put on cards simultaneously. Counting points for the round: the host gets X2 the number to pieces on the initial card, guesses get +2 points, for every piece on wrongly guessed words their authors get +1. Then we start over and play till the end of initial cards stack.</p><p>It’s a really fun experience ) It challenges our linguistic capabilities, but it seems they’re really somehow built into us, at least everyone can just randomly press keys on a keyboard or just press “generate”.</p><p>And here comes the second – I’m building an interactive dictionary of imagined words and their definitions. It’s based on reactive p2p graph database and involves some cryptographic primitives to ensure verifiable authorship into the dictionary. It’s a graph so every word can have as many authors, any author can create new words and definitions, empower others&#39; with co-authorship (different kinds of collective owning) and link them up together with others doing the same in real time.</p><p>We&#39;re only in the beginning, I’m creating it open-source from bottom-up and so who knows how it evolves later. But I see it as a good example of creative linguistics understood as creative use of the basic language structures of the human mind, That too may be rather interesting to professor.</p><p>I know he knows much from press, but we’re still very far from public recognition, so I thought I may shorten the way with this email. Just because I think he’d like it and, may be, tried to play at list in his deep mind. I’m not waiting for a response, just share some insight from first hands – may be that’s what Internet was made for )</p><p>Here are couple of links (currently only in russian): <a href="https://www.etovoteto.ru/" class="external-link" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">https://www.etovoteto.ru/</a> - the game web-site with rules and more <a href="https://app.etovoteto.ru/" class="external-link" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">https://app.etovoteto.ru/</a> - the interactive online dictionary web-app</p><p>Thank you for all the work!</p><p>Denis Starov.</p>',12),n=[i];function s(h,l,d,p,c,m){return t(),a("div",null,n)}const w=e(r,[["render",s]]);export{f as __pageData,w as default};
