Then in my late University times I started playing drums in a rock band. Bought electronic drums and studied rhythm for 5 years until I finally took on tonal side of music. To teach myself I used my graphic and web designer skills. I&#39;ve made print designs, stickers and web-apps for my own study first. And in years it developed into a whole Chromatone Visual Music Language. I use it as a way to go deeper into sound and music as an independent researcher, visually. That is eye-opening. And I love to share this discovery with everyone is interested in it, globally.</p><h2 id="jam-music-improvisation-collaboration" tabindex="-1">Jam - music improvisation collaboration <a class="header-anchor" href="#jam-music-improvisation-collaboration" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Jam - music improvisation collaboration&quot;">​</a></h2><p>Music is the language of souls. The deep and warm connections we build when these intricate patterns of sounds draw similar pictures in our souls. If you&#39;ve experienced it once, you will remember that feeling for long and will be happy to experience it again and in new and exciting circumstances. People of any musical level can participate in a jam according to their skill. We can set a set of basic rules to get quite predictable frame for improvisational music events. Live music composition is quite an art in itself. And it&#39;s what I&#39;m doing myself.</p><p><a href="https://tsoop.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer"><img src="'+o+'" alt="tsoop site"></a></p><h2 id="live-multimedia-production" tabindex="-1">Live multimedia production <a class="header-anchor" href="#live-multimedia-production" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Live multimedia production&quot;">​</a></h2><p>I&#39;ve published 4+ albums, 10+ music videos for my mostly live performances. I prefer preparing everything so that final music piece is mostly there at the moment of recording. Not layering it as a painter (<a href="https://www.ft.com/content/1fe8939e-ae19-4794-ac89-b34aa4821375" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">as Brian Eno noted about recorded music</a>), but having the exact frequency pattern we want right there at the moment. We can tune much later, but having this full main take recorded in one go is crucial to bring this moment closer to the listener. Anyway, I use both approaches, just prefer producing live.</p><h2 id="my-music-at-tsoop-com" tabindex="-1">My music at <a href="https://tsoop.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">tsoop.com</a> <a class="header-anchor" href="#my-music-at-tsoop-com" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;My music at [tsoop.com](https://tsoop.com)&quot;">​</a></h2><p>My music is all there on my music band web-site, where I have all the albums, singles, videos and interactive art experiments published.</p>',9),r=[n];function c(l,m,d,u,p,h){return a(),i("div",null,r)}const b=e(s,[["render",c]]);export{y as __pageData,b as default};
