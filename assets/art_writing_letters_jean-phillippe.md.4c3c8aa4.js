I’m the author of the open source WebMidi.js library. I wanted to personally thank you for filling out the survey back in April. I have started working on v3 and getting user feedback is very valuable to me. Regarding your suggestion to allow signal routing between INs and OUTs, you’ll be happy to know that this is something that’s already on my todo list for version 3. Regarding MIDI 2.0, I also wish I could support it but, until the Web MIDI API is updated, there isn’t much I can do. By the way, you can check out the new website. It only features the API documentation and a Forum for now but more should come later this year.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>Thank you so much for your time.

It has a nice suite of unit tests to check that new versions are not breaking anything. However, it is still an alpha and depending on the project’s needs I may need to introduce breaking changes. If stability is paramount, go with version 2. If you can tolerate a little change, you can jump to version 3.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>I checked out Chromatone and it’s pretty cool! Regarding your suggestion, I would be willing to consider it. I am also thinking of being able to pass a Note object to methods such as playNote().
