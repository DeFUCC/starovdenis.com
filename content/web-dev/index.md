## I build web-sites from school age

Learned HTML while already using some basic templates downloaded via modem. We've built a PHP powered school site with friends back then. Then there was long age of using Wordpress while learning JavaScript and going deep into the framework boom after AngularJS released. I was captivated by reactivity of Vue and have long experience building client-side web apps with no build steps. But then Vite comes out and with Vitepress they become the main build tool to create robust and lightweight apps. It can build single-file HTML files with everything baked in, essentially true local-first apps. The only thing needed is a way to connect these apps together. And I've got both Directus server database API for centralized data exchange and GUN reactive p2p secure graph database for pretty autonomous decentralized ones. Complete toolbox for building any app can be thinked of.

## What do I build?

You can check my [github.com](https://github.com/davay42)
 repositories and organizations I'm in. There are many kinds of projects. From the very minimalistic SVG + CSS [Axioma](https://axioma.defucc.me) to the future-proof [Gun-Vue](https://gun-vue.js.org). With [Chromatone](https://chromatone.center) collections, [Web-Synths](https://synth.playtronica.com) collaborations and [tsoop](https://tsoop.com) experiments somewhere in the middle. So yeah, mostly open source pieces of reactive web experience. But not only that.

## Open for collaboration

I use this same versatile toolset to create private repositories and servers too. I can build almost any web experience you can think of. I love to use it for great people, companies and their products to grow and become more organized, open and lightweight. I'm also more than interested in art and intermedia collaborations with artists from all over the world. My passion is to build gates from the web to the real world. Let's build something together!
