## I'm creating web-sites since IE

Learned **HTML** while already using some basic templates downloaded via modem. With friends we've built a **PHP** powered school site, with a forum. Then there was long time of me using Wordpress while learning **JavaScript** with **jQuery** until I first tried **AngularJS**. I was captivated by the idea of robust client side apps with seamless dynamic interface and real-time communications. In my expedition to the ocean of JS frameworks I finally settled Vue island and first had long experience creating no-build client-side web apps. There were struggles,

## Modern full-stack JavaScript apps to build tooling

But then Vite came out to replace outdated Webpack. ES6+ syntax enabled in Node makes the experience of coding for clients and for servers unified. Vitepress is now my go to tool to build web-sites and lightweight web-apps. With pure Vue I can build single-file HTML apps with everything baked in, essentially true local-first apps. And I've already got the way to connect them both via Directus server database API for centralized data exchange and via GUN reactive p2p secure graph database for pretty autonomous decentralized ones. With open source code, role based public APIs and containerized deployments. Complete toolbox to develop almost any app imaginable. Let's imagine!

## What do I build?

You can look at my [github.com](https://github.com/davay42)
 repositories and organizations I'm in. There are many kinds of projects. From the very minimalistic SVG + CSS [Axioma](https://axioma.defucc.me) to the future-proof [Gun-Vue](https://gun-vue.js.org). With [Chromatone](https://chromatone.center) collections, [Web-Synths](https://synth.playtronica.com) collaborations and [tsoop](https://tsoop.com) experiments somewhere in the middle. So yeah, mostly open source pieces of reactive web experiences. But not only that.

## Open for collaboration

I use this same versatile toolset to create private repositories, apps and servers too. I can build almost any web experience you can think of. I love to use it for great people, companies and their products to grow and become more organized, lightweight and open. I'm also more than interested in art and intermedia collaborations with artists from all over the world. My passion is to build gates from the web of computers to the real world of people. Let's build something together!
