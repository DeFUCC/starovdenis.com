title: 100 Tools, Apps, and Platforms I Can Build With My Stack
description: Though most users probably think of Directus as a Headless CMS, the platform is _so_ much more than that.
---

Because we built Directus _data_\-first vs. _content_\-first, you can use it to spin up any digital app or project that pops in your head.

As one user said â€“

> "I can get an idea in the morning, quickly build the data model and backend with Directus, and have a fully-functioning MVP in the afternoon."

Since developers often ask us what types of projects they can tackle with Directus, we thought weâ€™d compile a list of the top use cases we could think of off the top of our head (there are more, but this is a start ðŸ˜‰)

Whether you're an [enterprise building composable architecture](https://directus.io/solutions/enterprise) or a developer looking to level-up your coding skills, here's a list of 100 tools, apps, and platforms you can build with Directus.
