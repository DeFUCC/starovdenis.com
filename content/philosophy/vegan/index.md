I've started my vegetarian experiments at 2006 at transitioned to complete vegan lifestyle at 2008. It was gradual process. At first very intellectual and quite offensive, but then more intricate and personal transformation. Plants can give us enough to grow and be successful human beings. We now have all the elements for that. Let animals live.

## Vegan diet basics

### Carbohydrates

Sugars are fuel to be burnt by motions and thoughts. Adjust according to your current burn rate.

### Fats

Fats are for greasing.

### Protein

Eat enough plant protein daily - 1g/kg of body weight

## My daily vegan breakfast

Ingredients:

- 1 apple
- 1 measure spoon on soy/pea protein
- 2 pinches of sesame
- ~ 10 peeled pumpkin seeds or almonds
- 100 ml of coconut milk
- 100 ml of mango juice
- 2 handfuls of not sweet corn flakes
- a pinch of cinnamon

Cut the apple, put along with all dry ingredients into a bowl. Add coconut milk and mango juice and stir to mix. Then add corn flakes, mix again and sprinkle some cinnamon on top. Breakfast ready! Fast, nutricious and delicious every time! High protein and good fat content make such breakfast very long lasting - I can forget about food for 4-6 hours.

## My daily dinner

So if I eat my breakfast around 9-11 AM in the morning, I start thinking about food again around 4-5 PM.Â I like cooking myself, have enough skill and creativity in that.

Basic idea is simple.Take any kind of protein - textured soy, tofu skin, vegan sausages or anything like that. Take any carbohydrates - pasta, rice, buckwheat or beans. Take any vegetables - brokkoli, green beans, cauliflower. Cook separately, then mix and fry with some vegetable oil and spices. Experiment every time and find your favourite combinations. Yum!

## Additives

I am aware of the B12 issue for vegans and regularly ingest a pill of it before eating. Also just some regular polyvitamin tablets I drink before food every two days or something. This keeps me energized and balances out any lackings. Feeling good for more than 10 years already!
