I've started my vegetarian experiments at 2006 at transitioned to complete vegan lifestyle at 2008. It was gradual process. At first very intellectual and quite offensive, but then more intricate and personal transformation. Plants can give us enough to grow and be successful human beings. We now have all the elements for that. Let animals live.

## Vegan diet basics

### Carbohydrates

Sugars are fuel to be burnt by motions and thoughts. Adjust according to your current burn rate.

Fats are for greasing.

Eat enough plant protein daily - 1g/kg of body weight
