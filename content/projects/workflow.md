## Here's a simplified scheme of productive collaboration with me as a freelance desugner, developer and educator

1. You reach me out and describe your project/task/position offer.
2. I ask questions and get some basic understanding to estimate time and efforts needed to accomplish it.
3. I propose you my estimated work schedule and payment terms.
4. My payment rate varies by urgency and skillset involved in the project. Discounted for open-source code.
5. We negotiate and approve the collaboration conditions.
6. I send you a link to securely pay for initial hours that we have estimated and approved.
7. I get to work with timer and weekly progress reports.
8. You accept the results weekly and pay for time estimated for next week or two.
9. We continue this process until the requirements are met.
10. We finalize the project, you pay me the last payment, that includes premium and all bonuses.
11. I provide you a repository with all of the source code, layout files and finished product.
12. Developer support and self-hosted services for the product can be negotiated.
