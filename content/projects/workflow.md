## How we may iterate on ideas and use some of my time to make them real

1. You reach me out and describe the offer of your project/task/position.
2. I will ask questions that help estimate time and efforts needed to accomplish it.
3. I propose you my estimated work schedule and payment terms.
4. My base rate is $30-90/hour, varies by urgency and skillset involved. Discounted for open-source code.
6. We negotiate and approve the project conditions.
7. I send you a link to securely buy some initial hours of our estimations.
8. I get to work with timer and weekly progress reports.
9. You accept the results and pay for the time spent in a next week period.
10. We continue this process until the requirements are met.
11. We finalize the project, you pay me the last payment, that includes all the bonuses and premium.
12. I provide you a repository with all of the source code, layout files and finished product.
13. Support and services for the product can be negotiated as new projects.
