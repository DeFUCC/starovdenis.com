## Profile

I am a freelance digital designer and frontend developer with very wide skillset. I have more than 10 years of experience in web technologies. I build UIs with Vue and many other amazing open source libraries. Like Paper.js providing clever SVG animations and WebGL shaders for effects and fast renders. Or like VueUse reactive browser APIs and BLE device control and monitoring. Or the TailwindCSS and WebAudio + WebMIDI APIs. From installable PWAs to on-device audio analysis.

I am passionate about working on impactful projects. I'm open for participation in creative industry and art projects, involving experiments with audio synthesis, vector graphics, web animations, interfaces and intermedia.
