## Profile

[GitHub Profile](https://github.com/davay42) | [Personal Website](http://starovdenis.com) | [LinkedIn profile](https://www.linkedin.com/in/denis-starov/)

I am a freelance digital and print designer and frontend developer with very wide skillset. I have more than 10 years of experience in web technologies. I build UIs with Vue and many other amazing open source libraries. I can build an interactive experience or a digital product from ground up by myself or or in collaborations with your remote team.

I am passionate about working on impactful projects. I'm open for participation in creative industry and art projects, involving experiments with audio synthesis, vector graphics, web animations, interfaces and intermedia.

The resulting design, site or app can be closed source and you will get all the IP rights generated in the process. But I do have a discounted rate for open-source projects.
